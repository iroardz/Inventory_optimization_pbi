# Inventory optimization

## Introduction
The dashboard below is an example focusing on inventory optimization. In it, we can find various pages that help us  break down the client's inventory from general to particular. The information is in Spanish because the client is Mexican but you will find a small summary of each sheet below.

## Goal
The purpose of the dashboard is to give the users a general and particular view of their inventory, in order to make informed decisions. Thus, the user will be able to know which pieces sell the most and where, as well as which pieces do not have much turnover and only take up space in their warehouse.

## Results
With the information that the dashboard gives, the client was able to save several million pesos (a confidential amount) on the materials that did not have rotation, just as they won in the materials that their market needed.

## Duration
This project took about 4 weeks, we use the agile methodology, where every week we receive feedback from the client to reach the final product. The data does not need much cleaning, the dashboard is automatically updated daily and is connected to an on-premise SQL database.

## Description
1. Vista General:  it is a general picture of the current state of the inventory. Here we can filter the information at different levels (system, line, sales, etc.).
2. Vista del inventario y cobertura: analysis of the materials and their coverage. It tells us which materials have a car with which we can associate it.
